Hi, I'm Pitamber Singh, a B.Tech student specializing in [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) at [Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology](https://www.niet.co.in/), located in the vibrant Delhi-NCR region. With a strong foundation in programming, I am proficient in Python, Java, C, C++, R, and Object-Oriented Programming [(OOP)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/).

My passion lies in leveraging data-driven insights and innovative technologies to solve real-world problems. As I continue to enhance my skills and knowledge, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the field of data science and technology.
